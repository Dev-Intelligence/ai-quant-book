# Part 2: Quantitative Fundamentals

> **Goal for this stage:** Build a solid foundation. Understand how markets work, how data is processed, how strategies are validated, and where risks come from. Without these fundamentals, the Agents we build later are castles in the air.

## After Completing This Stage

You will be able to:
- Understand the characteristics of different markets: stocks, futures, cryptocurrencies
- Describe returns and risk using mathematical language
- Recognize the real value and limitations of technical indicators
- Build data pipelines, handling API rate limits, missing data, and other issues
- Avoid common backtesting pitfalls (overfitting, lookahead bias, etc.)
- Understand the difference between Beta and Alpha, and know where returns come from
- Calculate hedge ratios and understand why market neutrality is difficult
