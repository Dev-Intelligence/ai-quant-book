## 4. Industry Trends

### 4.1 Consolidation at the Top

```
2025 Jan-Nov Private Fund Registration Statistics:
- Total market registrations: 11,210 funds
- Top 20 registrants: All 10B+ RMB private equity firms
- Quant private equity share: 85%

10B+ RMB Quant Private Equity Count Changes:
End of Q1 2025: 33 firms
Early August 2025: 44 firms
Growth: 33%
```

**Implications**: The industry has entered a mature competition phase that is both capital-intensive and technology-intensive. Small and medium institutions face survival pressure.

### 4.2 Frequency Reduction Trend

```
Driving Factors:
1. Regulatory constraints (strict HFT classification standards)
2. Capacity bottleneck (HFT cannot support hundreds of billions in AUM)

Results:
- Medium/low-frequency strategies gaining importance
- Excess returns inevitably declining
- Requires continuous innovation in strategy depth and breadth
```

### 4.3 AI-Native Competition

```
Competition Focus Shifting To:
├── High-Flyer: DeepSeek LLM cross-domain generalization
├── Nine-Kun: Microsoft partnership to replicate vertical AI scenarios
├── Minghong: Industrialized factor production
└── Yanfu: Wall Street methodology optimization

Essence: Three-dimensional competition of Talent Density x Computing Reserves x Data Ecosystem
```
